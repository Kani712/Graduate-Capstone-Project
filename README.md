# Graduate-Capstone-Project

## Overview
  This project explores the use of deep learning to perform Traffic Sign Classification using the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Dataset**. The dataset is first explored to visualize the training images and appropriate pre-processing and image augmentation techniques are applied to balance the data. A VGG-net architecture is then implemented in TensorFlow and trained using the augmented training data. Finally, the model is evalued against some additional traffic sign images sources from the web.
  
This repository has:
* Code folder contains all the necessary files
* A Jupyter notebook contains the code
* Saved_data and test_images data contains the savel model
* A set of publicly available web_images downloaded from the internet used to test the model
